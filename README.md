# ToDoList
# Project Overview



## Project Description
[Git hub link here](https://suspicious-easley-b09860.netlify.app/)
To-do-list is an online task reminder app created with React and Airtable. User creates a task by entering information into a form. The form updates the main page window with a list of tasks the user has entered.  When completed the user clicks on the check mark, the task is moved into the completed task list. This is so a user can have a convenient location to view tasks pending.

SWOT Analysis
Strengths:
I have a general idea of what I want to do. Its pretty basic functionality and I can draw from the lessons and projects I did in the past.

Weaknesses:
My understanding of the overall process from making api calls with hooks is still at a basic level. Also my styling is still a work in progress.

Opportunities:
This project allows me to gain more confidence to building components in react and wire them together to create crud functionality with the knowledge gained from the past two weeks. This project also allows me to further my first three weeks of the class on styling.

Threats:
Im not that big on styling and I tend to spend lots of time thinking it could look better.
