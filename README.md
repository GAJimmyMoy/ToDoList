## To do list


## Project Description
[Git hub link here](https://github.com/GAJimmyMoy/ToDoList)
User creates a task by entering information into a form. The form updates the main page window with a list of tasks the user has entered.  When completed the user clicks on the check mark, the task is moved into the completed task list. This is so a user can have a convenient location to view tasks pending.
